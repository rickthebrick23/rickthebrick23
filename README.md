- 👋 Hi, I’m @rickthebrick23
- 👀 I’m interested in ... coding, duh.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning java, javascript, sql, c/c++, python, and a few more. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet. I will when I'm out of school. Start of 2023. But I want to work on GUIs to make people's lives easier.
- 📫 How to reach me... you don't, I reach you. J/K. I'm not ready to be reached out to yet.
